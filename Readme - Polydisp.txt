Polytope's Revised Dispel Magic Mechanic

Dispel Magic was long known to be bugged in vanilla (never working when a caster attempts to dispel effects above his or her own level), but even when fixed by executable hacks/EE the spell as per developer description matches poorly to 2e rules: All spell effects from a particular caster are dispelled if successful, rather than each checked individually, more importantly it's still a fool's game to throw Remove Magics at buffed spellcasters who are even slightly higher level than the party, because while chance of success increases by 5% per level above the target, it decreases by 10% per level below. Similarly, many players with AI enhancing mods - notably Sword Coast Stratagems - have noticed how hopeless it is to try and preserve buffs on your characters against arcane casters without Spell Immunity.

My mod substantially changes the rules for Dispel Magic, chance of success or failure is now incremented +/-3% per level difference. This softening reflects the much higher level of most spellcasting opponents a party will encounter. Conversely for a solo character, or even for a full party late game, remove magics from low to mid level enemies like drow and Glabrezu will still be a threat. The school of magic that has been dispelled will also be displayed in game (including potions that closely resemble a spell), and erroneous "dispel effects" strings are omitted on creatures that were not actually effected. This also resolves some inconsistencies with dispelling Polymorph Self and suchlike (if you don't already have it fixed) innate shapechanging on the other hand cannot be dispelled. In addition, if a character has levels in multiple classes, the highest is checked when they are the target of Dispel Magic, this makes protective potions more useful and dual classing from (rather than to) a spellcasting profession more viable. 

Other notable changes are that Inquisitors cast their innate variant of Dispel Magic at 4 levels higher than their experience level, Nishruus and Mordy swords will be destroyed by a successful dispelling (I'm not the first to implement this), while golems will be immobilized for one round if the check would have succeeded and they fail a save vs spell (this is per 2e, but mostly useful with the tweak to Carsomyr, it's probably not worth a high level mage's time casting Remove Magics at them).

In comparison, likelihood of dispel succeeding as 12th level inquisitor vs mages of:

==========17th level======21st level======25th level

Vanilla........85%.............65%..........0%

With fix.......85%.............65%..........45%

With SCS nerf..55%.............20%..........1%

Polytope.......53%.............41%..........29%

And as a 15th level bard:

==========17th level======21st level======25th level

Vanilla.........0%.............0%...........0%

With fix.......30%.............1%...........1%

Polytope.......44%.............32%..........20%

Likelihood of a 21st level mage dispelling targets of:

==========12th level=======15th level======18th level

Vanilla........95%............80%...........65%

Polytope.......77%............68%...........59%

For balance I've also included an option to make spells of the 7th circle and higher undispellable, although they might still be taken down by Breach, True Sight etc. This means Protection from Magic Weapons, Protection from Fire etc. are no longer peculiarly more useful than their greater counterparts. Beneficial spells affected by this are Regeneration, Mass Invisibility, (Improved) Mantle, Protection from The Elements/Energy, Absolute Immunity, Black Blade of Disaster and Shapechange. Harmful spells include (Un) Holy Word, Creeping Doom (which might be undispellable anyway, dependent on your mod setup) Nature's Beauty, Power Word Stun/Blind & Symbol Spells.

Lastly there is a choice to make Carsomyr and the Arrow of Dispelling more similar to their PnP counterparts. This disables the upgrade to Carsomyr, on the other hand it's now usable by non-evil characters besides paladins, but only they get the full benefits of a Holy Avenger.
